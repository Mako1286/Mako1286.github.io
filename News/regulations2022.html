  <h1>What’s New for F1 2022: Technical Regulations, Explained.</h1>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6" ">
      <p> Every new season of Formula One is exciting. Different. Has an element of unknown. But 2022 is like no other season that has come before it...

Vastly different regulations have the potential to completely switch up the game. All the teams and Power Unit manufacturers have had to adapt to these new rules, and we'll soon find out just how different the end result looks, compared to previous iterations of F1 machinery.

The aim of these new regulations is to improve the on-track action, enabling cars to follow each other more closely, and therefore be in a better position to attack and battle, as well as having the potential effect of mixing up the competitive order. With every new change, comes a new opportunity.

For proof of just how ground-breaking these new regulations are, here's what James Allison, our Chief Technical Officer, had to say: "I've been working in the sport for over 30 years, and they dwarf everything else I have ever seen! I suspect if I were to dig out Wikipedia and go through every season of the sport that has ever been there would be nothing to match the scale of the change that comes with 2022." </p>

	<div class="col-sm-6"">
      <p>The changes for this season are unlike any seen before and have allowed teams to push boundaries further than ever, in the hopes of creating the fastest car possible. It's a challenge that we have relished and an opportunity to prove, once again, what we - as a team and a collective - are made of. As James explains: "We see it an opportunity to show that we haven't just been lucky over the years. We haven't merely stumbled into a formula that is often talked about as the turbo hybrid era, as if we sort of stumbled into some God given right to have been dominant all these years.

"And when everything is as new as this, then everywhere you look in that regulation set, twice as thick as the old one, there is opportunity. There is opportunity, and of course there is jeopardy. And we try to pick our way through the potential minefield, picking up all the little boxes of treasure that might be set in amongst the landmines, to end up with a car that we hope will see us pitching at the front of the grid."</p>
