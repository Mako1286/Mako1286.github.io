  <h1>Biography</h1>
<p>Born on June 27 1985 in Wiesbaden, Nico Rosberg, son of Finnish Formula One World Champion Keke, had motor racing in his DNA right from birth. He gained his first experience of karting at just six years old and, by the time he turned 16, had fought his way up to the highest echelon of kart racing - International Formula Super A.

In 2002, his talent was recognised with a drive in the Formula BMW series - racing for Team Rosberg, his father's outfit. Nico emphatically proved that he had not been given the drive simply by virtue of his name by winning the Championship. That same year, he would be rewarded for his achievements with a first Formula One test with the Williams F1 Team. Ages 17, he was, at the time, the youngest driver ever to get behind the wheel of a Formula One racing car.

Nico did not get his driver's licence until one year later – but had by then already made quite a name for himself in the Formula 3 Euro Series. In 2005, French team ART Grand Prix signed Nico to drive in the GP2 Series, where once again there would be no stopping him. He left the competition trailing in his debut season to be crowned Champion. Again, Frank Williams knocked at the Rosberg door – this time to offer Nico a full-time drive in Formula One.
On March 12 2006, Nico made his Formula One debut for Williams as team-mate to Mark Webber and instantly impressed by posting the fastest lap of the race. Aged just 20 years, 8 months and 13 days old at the time, he remains the youngest driver ever to have achieved this feat. In addition, he belongs to an elite group of drivers (Giuseppe Farina, Masahiro Hasemi and Jacques Villeneuve) who all succeeded in posting the fastest lap in their maiden Grand Prix.

After four years with Williams, Nico sought a new challenge and, in 2010, signed with the Silver Arrows. He finished on the podium in only his third race for the team – repeating that feat in China and again in the Brackley squad's home race at Silverstone.

On April 14 2012 Nico secured his first Formula One pole position and then, one day later, his first win at the Chinese Grand Prix. His next victory would prove an historic one at the 2013 Monaco Grand Prix - taking the flag exactly 20 years after his father Keke had won the prestigious race in the Principality. Nico finished his fourth season for MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS in sixth place overall on 171 world Championship points – including victories in Monaco and Great Britain.

In 2014, a season-long battle with MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS team-mate Lewis Hamilton saw Nico narrowly miss out on a first World Championship title after a dramatic season finale in Abu Dhabi. As runner-up, Nico claimed five race wins, 15 podium finishes, five fastest race laps and the inaugural pole position trophy, having claimed top spot on the grid no less than 11 times in the 19 race calendar. Highlights included a second consecutive win at the Monaco Grand Prix, plus a home victory in Germany.

2015 brought another impressive but ultimately frustrating campaign for Nico. Six victories, 15 podium finishes, seven pole positions and five fastest race laps would once again see the German fall just short of his title ambition. A combination of bad luck and imperious early season form from team-mate Lewis Hamilton consigned Nico to the runner-up spot once more with three Grands Prix remaining. However, not to be kept down, Nico subsequently bounced back to dominate those final three rounds – demonstrating both speed and strength of character to end a tough year on a high.</p>
